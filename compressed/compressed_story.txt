King Ryan and Queen Yong Yong are taking a stroll through the Royal Gardens in RyRy Land on a warm sunny day. They discuss their plans for the upcoming Harvest Festival and meet Esther, a 72-million-year-old dragon who has been an advisor to the royal family. Esther offers them words of wisdom about balance and harmony in nature. The queen notices a rare flower blooming nearby, and the king reveals that he's been cultivating it secretly for her.

Esther transforms into a handsome young man with piercing blue eyes, and the queen is immediately captivated by him. King Ryan welcomes the stranger into their company, and Esther-as-a-man joins them on their stroll. The queen subtly flirts with him, but Esther remains oblivious to the queen's advances. Dowager Mae summons King Ryan to her chambers, proposing that he take Cousin Chooryo as his concubine to strengthen the royal bloodline.

King Ryan is horrified by the suggestion and tries to reason with his mother, who is resolute in her proposal. Meanwhile, Queen Yong Yong senses something is amiss but doesn't know about the dowager's plan. King Ryan meets with Princess Chooryo and finds himself drawn to her adventurous spirit and independence. He begins to see her in a different light, and his initial reluctance to consider polygamy starts to waver.

The queen continues to flirt with Esther-as-a-man, unaware of his true nature as a dragon. King Ryan is aware of the queen's actions and feels betrayed, wondering why she's not devoting attention to him.
King Ryan is torn between his duty to his mother, Queen Yong Yong, and his growing attraction to Princess Chooryo. Wen Kang, an ancient dragon, awakens from a 127 million-year slumber feeling hungover after drinking one glass of beer. He is repulsed by the beauty of RyRy Land and declares his intention to destroy it.

The kingdom's leaders are caught off guard by Wen Kang's sudden appearance and threat. Sebastian, the oracle of RyRy Land, appears and reveals a vision that holds the key to defeating Wen Kang. The vision shows a child born of King Ryan's true love who will possess the power to save the kingdom.

King Ryan is unsure how to navigate his feelings for Queen Yong Yong and Princess Chooryo while also preparing for battle against Wen Kang. Six years pass, and King Ryan takes Princess Chooryo as his new queen. However, Queen Yong Yong has been driven into alcoholism by Esther's indifference and her own heartbreak.

Queen Chooryo settles into her new role and is determined to bring joy and prosperity back to RyRy Land. Natalie, the child of King Ryan and Queen Chooryo, grows up in the palace and begins to exhibit signs of unimaginable power. Esther observes Natalie's growth with concern, unsure of how to react or what her role should be.

The kingdom is on the cusp of a new era, but the ghosts of the past linger, and the consequences of King Ryan's decisions will continue to shape the fate of RyRy Land.
