RyRy Land

It is a warm, sunny day in RyRy Land. King Ryan and Queen Yong Yong are taking a leisurely stroll through the Royal Gardens, surrounded by blooming flowers and towering trees. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blossoming cherry trees and the soft chirping of birds.
As they walk, they discuss their plans for the upcoming Harvest Festival, a grand celebration that brings together the people of RyRy Land to give thanks for the bounty of the land. The queen is particularly excited about the festival, as it will be the first one she's hosted as the new queen.
As they turn a corner, they come across Esther, the 72-million-year-old dragon, lounging in a sun-drenched clearing. Esther is an ancient, wise, and gentle dragon who has been a loyal advisor to the royal family for centuries. She's known for her deep understanding of the natural world and her ability to communicate with the creatures of RyRy Land.
The king and queen stop to chat with Esther, who offers them some words of wisdom about the importance of balance and harmony in the natural world. As they talk, the queen notices a rare, exquisite flower blooming nearby, and the king surprises her by revealing that he's been cultivating it in secret, just for her.

Esther, in her dragon form, has been observing the king and queen's interactions with great interest. She decides to take on a new form, one that will allow her to better understand the humans she's grown fond of. With a burst of magical energy, Esther transforms into a handsome young man with piercing blue eyes and chiseled features.
The queen, unaware of Esther's true nature, is immediately captivated by the stranger's charms. She finds herself stealing glances at him, feeling an inexplicable flutter in her chest. King Ryan, oblivious to the queen's fascination, welcomes the stranger into their company, and Esther-as-a-man joins them on their stroll through the gardens.
As they walk, the queen finds herself growing more and more comfortable around the stranger, feeling an ease with him that she's never experienced before. She begins to subtly flirt with him, playfully teasing him and laughing at his witty remarks. Esther, however, is completely oblivious to the queen's advances. She's never experienced human emotions before and doesn't understand the subtle cues and signals that the queen is sending her way.
As Yong Yong sits in the royal garden, she feels frustrated and confused, unsure why she's drawn to this enigmatic stranger, and Esther feeling equally perplexed, wondering why the queen is behaving so strangely around her.

One day Dowager Mae, the matriarch of RyRy Land and mother of King Ryan, summons King Ryan to her chambers, her expression stern and unyielding. She presents him with a proposal that leaves him reeling: she wants him to take his royal kin, Cousin Chooryo, as his concubine. The dowager argues that this union will strengthen the royal bloodline and secure the future of RyRy Land.
King Ryan is horrified by the suggestion, feeling that it would be a betrayal of his love for Queen Yong Yong. He tries to reason with his mother, explaining that he's committed to his queen and that polygamy goes against his personal values. However, Dowager Mae is resolute, citing the ancient traditions of RyRy Land and the importance of maintaining the royal lineage.
Meanwhile, Queen Yong Yong senses that something is amiss, but she's unaware of the dowager's proposal. She notices King Ryan's distraction and tries to reach out to him, but he's too preoccupied with his own turmoil to respond.
King Ryan, now torn between his duty to his mother and his love for his queen. He's unsure of how to navigate this treacherous situation, and the fate of his relationship with Queen Yong Yong hangs in the balance.

King Ryan meets with Princess Chooryo, feeling obligated to fulfill his duty to his mother and the royal family. However, he's surprised to find that Cousin Chooryo is not the timid, obedient princess he expected. Instead, she's outgoing, adventurous, and possesses a spark of independence that intrigues him.
As they spend more time together, King Ryan finds himself enjoying Princess Chooryo's company, feeling drawn to her carefree spirit and zest for life. He begins to see her in a different light, and his initial reluctance to consider polygamy starts to waver.
Meanwhile, Queen Yong Yong continues to subtly flirt with Esther-as-a-man, unaware of the dragon's true nature. King Ryan, however, is acutely aware of the queen's actions, and it's eating away at him. He feels betrayed, wondering why his queen is so drawn to this stranger, and why she's not devoting the same attention to him.
King Ryan, now torn between his duty to his mother and his growing attraction to Princess Chooryo, while also struggling to come to terms with Queen Yong Yong's behavior. He's unsure of how to navigate this complex web of emotions, and the fate of his relationships hangs precariously in the balance.

Wen Kang, a dragon of unimaginable power and age, awakens from his 127 million year slumber, feeling rather... hungover. It seems that a single glass of beer was enough to knock him out for an eternity. As he stretches his massive wings and takes to the skies, he's greeted by the vibrant, colorful landscape of RyRy Land.
However, Wen Kang's reaction to the kingdom's beauty is not one of wonder or delight. Instead, he's repulsed by the very essence of RyRy Land. He finds the bubbly, inviting, and loving nature of the country to be an affront to his own gruff, grumpy demeanor. The dragon's disgust is so great that he declares his intention to destroy RyRy Land, citing its "excessive cheerfulness" as a crime against the natural order.
King Ryan, Queen Yong Yong, Princess Chooryo, and Esther-as-a-man are all caught off guard by Wen Kang's sudden appearance and threat. They're unsure of how to respond, as the dragon's power is legendary and his wrath is feared throughout the land.
As the fate of RyRy Land hangs in the balance. Ryan has come to an impass as to what he has to do to protect the ones he holds dear.

Sebastian, the enigmatic oracle of RyRy Land, appears before King Ryan, his eyes aglow with an otherworldly intensity. The oracle reveals that he has witnessed a vision, one that holds the key to defeating the ancient dragon Wen Kang and saving the kingdom.
In the vision, Sebastian saw a child, born of King Ryan's true love, who will possess the power to cast light into the endless dark caused by Wen Kang's destruction. The oracle's words are cryptic, but they hint at a deeper connection between King Ryan, Princess Chooryo, and the fate of RyRy Land.
King Ryan is both intrigued and unsettled by the oracle's vision. He's unsure of what to make of the prophecy, or how to reconcile his feelings for Queen Yong Yong with the possibility of a new love and a child who will save the kingdom.
Meanwhile, Queen Yong Yong senses that something is amiss, but she's unaware of the oracle's vision or King Ryan's growing feelings for Princess Chooryo. She's still drawn to Esther-as-a-man, and her actions continue to create tension in her relationship with the king.
King Ryan, left to ponder the oracle's words, and the weight of his responsibilities as the ruler of RyRy Land. He knows that he needs to navigate the complex web of his emotions, while also preparing for the battle against Wen Kang and the fate that awaits his kingdom.

Six years have passed since the oracle's vision, and King Ryan has made the difficult decision to take Princess Chooryo as his new queen. The ceremony is grand, with the entire kingdom in attendance, but the atmosphere is bittersweet. Queen Yong Yong, once the beloved queen, has been driven into alcoholism by Esther's indifference and her own heartbreak.
As Queen Chooryo settles into her new role, she's determined to bring joy and prosperity back to RyRy Land. However, the shadow of Queen Yong Yong's downfall looms large, a reminder of the consequences of Esther's actions and the king's decision.
Meanwhile, Natalie, the child of King Ryan and Queen Chooryo, is growing up in the palace. She's a curious and energetic child, but there's something unusual about her. As she begins to exhibit signs of unimaginable power, the kingdom is abuzz with excitement and trepidation.
Esther, still in her male form, observes Natalie's growth with a mix of fascination and concern. She's aware of the prophecy surrounding the child, but she's unsure of how to react or what her role should be in Natalie's life.
The kingdom is on the cusp of a new era, with Queen Chooryo at the helm and Natalie's powers growing by the day. However, the ghosts of the past linger, and the consequences of King Ryan's decisions will continue to shape the fate of RyRy Land.
